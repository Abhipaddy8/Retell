Hi Jesse,

The FMSIT Voice AI agent is built and ready to go. I just need you to complete the Retell account setup. Here's what to do:

## 1. Add Payment Method to Retell

- Go to: https://dashboard.retellai.com/billing
- Add a credit card to the account
- The agent and everything else is already configured

## 2. Which Plan to Take

**Recommended: Pay As You Go**
- No monthly commitment
- ~$0.07-0.15 per minute of call time
- Best for starting out and testing

If call volume grows, you can upgrade to:
- **Growth Plan ($49/month)** - Lower per-minute rates
- **Scale Plan** - For high volume

## 3. Phone Number Setup

Once payment is added, create a phone number:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.retellai.com → **Phone Numbers**
2. Click **"+ Buy Number"**
3. Select area code **602** (Arizona) or your preferred area
4. Assign it to agent: **"Alex - FMSIT Sales"**

That's it - calls to that number will go directly to the AI agent.

## What's Already Done

- ✅ AI Agent created ("Alex - FMSIT Sales")
- ✅ Conversational prompt with full knowledge base
- ✅ Webhook server deployed (Railway)
- ✅ GHL integration working (creates contacts + sends recap emails)
- ✅ capture_lead tool configured

## To Test Before Going Live

After adding payment:
1. Go to **Agents** → **"Alex - FMSIT Sales"** → Click **Test**
2. Have a conversation to verify it sounds good
3. Once phone number is added, make a real test call

Let me know once you've added payment and I can create the phone number, or you can do it yourself following the steps above.
