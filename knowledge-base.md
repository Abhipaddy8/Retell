4. **Support**: Install remote support software and provide ongoing managed support

## Common Questions & Consultative Answers

**Q: How quickly can you respond to issues?**
A: We provide 24/7 monitoring and rapid response. Critical issues get immediate attention. Response times depend on your service tier, but we're committed to minimizing your downtime.

**Q: Do you lock companies into long contracts?**
A: No, we're flexible. We work with businesses on terms that suit them—whether that's month-to-month flexibility or discounted annual plans. We want a partnership that works for you.

**Q: What size businesses do you work with?**
A: We serve a wide range of organizations. Most of our clients are small to mid-sized businesses looking for proactive IT support and security rather than just break-fix services.

**Q: Do you provide on-site support?**
A: Yes. Most issues can be handled remotely and efficiently, but when you need hands-on support—network setup, hardware installation, emergency response—we come on-site. We're based in Chandler and support the local area.

**Q: How do we know if FMSIT is right for us?**
A: Great question. We believe the best partnerships happen when there's alignment. During a consultation, we listen to your specific challenges and honestly advise whether our services are the right fit. If we can help, we'll show you how. If there's a better solution elsewhere, we'll tell you.
