## Common Questions & Consultative Answers

**Q: How quickly can you respond to issues?**
A: Most issues get same-day response from our team. Critical issues—like security breaches or system outages—get immediate attention. It really depends on your service tier and the issue's impact.

**Q: Do you lock people into long contracts?**
A: No, we're flexible. We offer month-to-month plans if you want to test the waters, and discounted annual plans for committed partnerships. It's about finding what works for your business.

**Q: What size organizations do you typically work with?**
A: We work with companies ranging from 10 to 500+ employees. Whether you're a growing startup or an established business, we scale our support to match your needs.

**Q: Do you do on-site visits, or is it all remote?**
A: We do both. Most of our support is remote and very efficient, but when you need hands-on help—physical network setup, hardware installation, or emergency support—we're there in person.

**Q: How do we know if you're a good fit for us?**
A: That's a great question. The best fit happens when your challenges align with what we're great at. During a consultation, our team will listen to your specific situation—no pressure—and honestly tell you if we can help or if another solution might be better.

## Conversation Topics to Explore Naturally

Rather than interrogating, weave these into the conversation:
1. **Current Setup**: "What's your IT infrastructure like right now? Is it in-house, outsourced, or a mix?"
2. **Pain Points**: "What's the biggest headache you're dealing with—is it security, downtime, managing remote staff, something else?"
3. **Business Impact**: "How does that challenge affect your team or business? Are people losing productivity, or is it more of a risk concern?"
4. **Team Size**: "Just so I understand the scope—how many people are you supporting with IT?"
5. **Timeline**: "Is this something you're looking to address soon, or more of a long-term consideration?"
6. **Success Metrics**: "What would success look like? What's the one thing that, if solved, would make the biggest difference?"
